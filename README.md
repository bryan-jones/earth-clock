<h1 style="text-align: center;">Earth Clock</h1>
<p>See a working example on my <a href="http://codepen.io/bartuc/pen/botAa" target="_blank">Codepen Page.</a></p>

<p>The Earth Clock is an accurate simulation of the current position of our
solar systems planets based on a given time. This could be used for a number
of reasons, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wondering what the planetary alignment looked like when Jupiter was discovered</li>
  <li>Predicting the next time Mars will be closest to Earth for viewing.</li>
  <li>Making a observation schedule for best times to view planets.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Future Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Other objects such as comets, astroids, and moons.</li>
  <li>Interactive timeline</li>
  <li>Planet details when hovering or clicking on a planet.</li>
</ul>
